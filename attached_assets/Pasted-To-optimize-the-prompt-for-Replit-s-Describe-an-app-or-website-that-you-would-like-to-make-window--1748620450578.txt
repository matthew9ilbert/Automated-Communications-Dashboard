To optimize the prompt for Replit’s “Describe an app or website that you would like to make” window, we need a concise, clear, and structured description tailored to Replit AI’s capabilities, focusing on generating a functional app or website. The original prompt for your Environmental Services (EVS) Manager automation system at Kaiser Permanente is comprehensive but too lengthy and detailed for Replit’s input window, which expects a focused app concept with key features. Below, I’ll refine the prompt to fit Replit’s interface, emphasizing a web-based app with core features (calendar management, text message screening, message scanning, AI to-do lists, smart reminders, staff tracking, and automated announcements) while leveraging Replit AI to generate, debug, and enhance the code. The refined prompt will prioritize automation, multiple-choice interfaces, and integration with Google Sheets (to align with your previous text message logging project) and Microsoft tools (Outlook, Teams) for Kaiser compatibility. I’ll ensure the prompt is formatted for clarity, avoids overloading Replit AI, and includes instructions for implementation within Replit’s environment.

Refined Prompt for Replit’s “Describe an app or website” Window
App Name: EVS Manager Automation Dashboard
Description: Build a web-based app to automate administrative tasks for an Environmental Services (EVS) Manager at Kaiser Permanente in Washington State, overseeing Bellevue Medical Center and four clinics. The app streamlines calendar management, text message screening, message scanning, AI-driven to-do lists, smart reminders, staff assignment tracking, and team announcements, reducing manual work to enable taking on an additional job. Use a Python Flask backend (hosted on Replit) with a React frontend for a user-friendly dashboard, integrating with Google Sheets for data storage, Microsoft Outlook/Teams for Kaiser compatibility, and iOS Shortcuts for mobile automation. All user interactions should use multiple-choice interfaces (dropdowns, checkboxes) to minimize typing.
Key Features:
	1	Calendar Management:
	◦	Extract events (e.g., meetings, audits) from text messages, emails, Teams messages, and Apple Notes.
	◦	Post events to Google Calendar and sync with Outlook.
	◦	Use multiple-choice prompts (e.g., “Add to Calendar? [Yes/No/Edit]”).
	2	Text Message Screening:
	◦	Scan incoming texts for priority keywords (e.g., “urgent,” “ASAP”).
	◦	Categorize as High/Medium/Low priority and notify via dashboard.
	◦	Offer actions (e.g., “Respond: [Call/Text/To-Do/Ignore]”).
	3	Message Scanner:
	◦	Scan texts, emails, Teams messages, voicemail transcripts, and Apple Notes every 15 minutes.
	◦	Identify tasks/events using NLP and add to to-do list/calendar.
	◦	Present actions (e.g., “Action: [To-Do/Calendar/Delegate/Ignore]”).
	4	AI To-Do List:
	◦	Populate tasks from scanned messages, prioritized by urgency.
	◦	Categorize by facility (e.g., Bellevue, Clinic A).
	◦	Update status via dropdowns (e.g., “Status: [Not Started/Completed]”).
	5	Smart Reminders:
	◦	Send persistent reminders for tasks/events with checkbox acknowledgment.
	◦	Reoccur every 30 minutes if unacknowledged (e.g., “Task Done? [Check]”).
	◦	Integrate with iOS Notifications.
	6	Staff Assignment Tracking:
	◦	Track staff coverage history (e.g., “John covered Clinic A”).
	◦	Suggest staff for assignments based on past agreements.
	◦	Assign via dropdowns (e.g., “Assign: [John/Sarah]”).
	7	Team Announcements & Calendars:
	◦	Post announcements to a public dashboard and send via email/text/Teams.
	◦	Maintain a shared calendar and project-specific calendars (e.g., “Clinic A Renovation”).
	◦	Use templates (e.g., “Announcement: [Assignment/Reminder]”).
Technical Requirements:
	•	Backend: Python Flask, hosted on Replit, storing data in Google Sheets.
	•	Frontend: React for a responsive dashboard with multiple-choice interfaces.
	•	Integrations:
	◦	Google Sheets API for task/event storage.
	◦	Google Calendar API for event posting.
	◦	Microsoft Graph API for Outlook/Teams (email, messages).
	◦	iOS Shortcuts for mobile automation (e.g., text screening).
	•	Security: Encrypt data, use OAuth for API access, comply with HIPAA.
	•	Replit AI Tasks:
	◦	Generate Flask routes for message scanning and task management.
	◦	Create React components for the dashboard.
	◦	Debug API integrations (e.g., Google Sheets, Microsoft Graph).
	◦	Optimize for performance (e.g., efficient scanning).
User Interface:
	•	Dashboard: Show to-do list, calendar, staff assignments, and announcements.
	•	Multiple-Choice: Dropdowns/checkboxes for all actions (e.g., task status, staff assignment).
	•	Mobile-Friendly: Accessible on iPhone via browser or iOS Shortcut.
Example Workflow:
	1	Text received: “Urgent: Clinic A cleaning needed ASAP.”
	2	App flags as High priority, suggests: “Action: [Assign/To-Do/Ignore].”
	3	Manager selects “Assign,” chooses “John” (suggested from past coverage).
	4	Task posted to Google Sheets, John notified via email/Teams, reminder set.
	5	Dashboard updates with new assignment and calendar event.
Deliverables:
	•	Flask backend code with Google Sheets and Microsoft Graph integration.
	•	React frontend for the dashboard.
	•	iOS Shortcut for text screening and calendar posting.
	•	Setup guide for Replit hosting and API credentials.
